# Description

## A simple `client side mod` that will show you which mods you have that might be out of date, based on age alone.

It will show you what version you have installed, the last time it updated, as well as the latest version available on https://valheim.thunderstore.io/. Mods listed in the UI are potential mods that you might need to remove due to age. Some mods can be older than the latest game update without issues. Keep that in mind and only use this as a guide in finding updates or bugs with your mods.

# Special Thanks

I would like to say thank you to Margmas for listening to me complain about the Thunderstore API not really being able
to map mods to it very well. His [ValheimModVersionCheck bot](https://github.com/MSchmoecker/ValheimModVersionCheck) is
something widely used in most Valheim modding discords.
He added an [API](https://mod-version-check.eu/api/docs#) so that I might leech off of the information he gathers. It
bridges the gap where Thunderstore's API
fell short. Thank you Margmas!
